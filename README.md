# Salesforce Inbound Email Handler

This Salesforce Inbound Email Handler is a powerful Apex class designed to efficiently process incoming emails and convert them into ticket records within Salesforce. It offers a seamless solution for managing customer inquiries, communication, and issue resolution directly within your Salesforce environment.

## Key Features

- **Email Parsing**: Parses incoming emails to extract relevant information such as email bodies, subjects, and metadata.
- **Email Splitting**: Splits email bodies based on predefined delimiters or patterns to extract meaningful sections.
- **Automatic Ticket Creation**: Automatically creates ticket records in Salesforce based on the parsed email content.
- **Email Metadata Handling**: Constructs metadata such as sender information, recipients, subject, and body to provide comprehensive details for each ticket.
- **Employee Identification**: Identifies whether the sender of the email is an employee within your Salesforce organization.
- **Email Attachment Handling**: Supports attachment handling by storing email attachments as attachments on the corresponding ticket records.
